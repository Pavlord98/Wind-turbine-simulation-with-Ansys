# Wind-turbine-simulation-with-Ansys

This is a steady-state 1-way Fluid-Structure analysis that consists of two parts. Part 1 is the simulation of the aerodynamic loading of a wind turbine blade (43.2 meters long and starts with a cylindical shape at the root and then transitions to airfoils S818, S825 and S826 for the root, body and tip, respectively).
These simulations are a recreation of the original simulations done by Edwin Corona with the help of a module authored by Sebastien Lachance-Barrett.
