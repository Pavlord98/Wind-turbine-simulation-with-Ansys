# Wind-turbine-simulation-with-Ansys

This is a steady-state 1-way Fluid-Structure analysis that consists of two parts. Part 1 is the simulation of the aerodynamic loading of a wind turbine blade (43.2 meters long and starts with a cylindical shape at the root and then transitions to airfoils S818, S825 and S826 for the root, body and tip, respectively).
These simulations are a recreation of the original simulations done by Edwin Corona with the help of a module authored by Sebastien Lachance-Barrett.

In part 2, the pressures on the wetted areas of the blade are passed as pressure loads to ANSYS Mechanical to determine stresses and deformations on the blade.

The ansys archive is too large for github so i have provided a google drive link [here](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1sSpGIuRF7XJjqYX7olfbYtqHkgZl3tbv/view?usp=sharing)
